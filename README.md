# HackerRank-Challenges
My solutions to the hacker-rank code challenges.


I learnt C++ using the (now discontinued) Turbo C++ compiler from Borland, no autocompletes, no special features, a blue editor background with yellow highlights. It still remains to this day, my language of choice. I still like to take up small coding challenges once in a while to keep myself in practice. Problem is, I never keep track of any of the solutions, so this is a repository where I plan on dumping everything related to that from now on. Enjoy.
